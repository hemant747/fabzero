# First Visit to the Fablab setup #

We visited the Fab lab setup and observed that various fabrication machine were installed in the lab
First we have seen the Laser cutter machine which using the class 4 laser light.Another  which is used to throughout the hot air and fumes and smoke was installed which has various filter and fine particals filter like the carbon  filter
We have seen 3d printer for the electronic PCB cutting along with the  de-soldering machine which is used to remove the components and it has three switched
like on ,off, cool and it should not be switched off directly.
One soldering machine along with a devices which will having the lead filter to protect from inhaling the harmful fumes.
