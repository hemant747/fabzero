# The step by step procedure for the PCB design using KiCAD as given below :-  
1. Open the Kicad application and open the file select the new schematic layout editor.  
2. Now when the schematic layout is open in it open the component and add the components as per the library available in the popup , this popup will be open when the cursor is double right click. 
3.When all the components are placed on the grid label them with respective symbolic names , please note if similar components are repeated one can be duplicated and pasted as per the circuit diagram.
4.The components after placing the layout sheet can be connected with wires button available at the right hand side .
