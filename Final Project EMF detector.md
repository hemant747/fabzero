   * About EMF Detector :- EMF (Electromagnetic field) occurs naturally and also come from manmade sources. Scientific studies suggest that electic and magnetic fields are unlikely to be harmful at the level normally found in homes,although there is some uncertainty regarding certain health effects. 
   Also it found that certain device do get influence and their performance is effected because of the electromagnetic field is need them, like the data cable are running parallel to the power cable with high electro magnetic field around it so result in  reduce the signal strength of that data cable cause signal disturbance. 
   Also if the cable carrying audio signal is running paralled power cable or passing near buy high power electrical device this may case audio signal to capture the humming sound at the output speaker and result is noise and humming sound at the output at Audio system.
